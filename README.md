<h1>SERP Counter + Notes - Free SERP Tool for SEO</h1>
<h3> Also works in any Chromium-based browser (Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi etc.</h3>

<span>Adds a counter to organic Google results + save notes for any site (URL or entire domain)

Free SEO tool that ranks organic Google results and allows saving notes for any site (URL or entire domain).

Works not only for the top 10, but across all pagination pages. The extension counts only organic results and ignores third-party SERP blocks (Products, People Also Ask, and similar) as well as paid ads. This makes it a simple way to see the exact position of a specific website for any query.

Notes feature: add notes to websites directly in the SERP. Apply a note to a specific URL or to an entire domain, so you can save quick insights while analyzing competitors — or any other text you want to keep next to the results.</span>
